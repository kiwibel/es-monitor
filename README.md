<h2> Monitoring Elasticsearch clusters and more</h2>
This is a simple poller that uses Elastic API. <br/>
It checks status of Elasticsearch cluster(s), notifies Slack if it is not green, and sends metrics to CloudWatch. <br/>

--- <br/> 
![Slask Example](./slack.png)

Default 4 clusters are defined: Monitoring, Development, Staging, Production <br/>
You can also modify clusters/names with cluster struct literals. <br/>
Define connection details with environment variables.


<h2> To run localy follow these steps: </h2>

- Clone this repo
- These envariable variables should be set:
  ```
  ES_PASSWORD_MON, ES_PASSWORD_DEV, ES_PASSWORD_STG, ES_PASSWORD_PROD
  ES_URL_MON, ES_URL_DEV, ES_URL_STG, ES_URL_PROD
  SLACK_TOKEN
  SLACK_CHANNEL
  AWS_REGION
  ```
- On Mac I recommend using keychain to store secrets locally e.g.:  
    `security add-generic-password -a "${USER}" -s "SLACK_TOKEN" -w` 

    Then add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc  
    `export SLACK_TOKEN=$(security find-generic-password -w -a "${USER}" -s "SLACK_TOKEN")`

- Build and run the app  
    `go build -o elastic-monitor && ./elastic-monitor`
